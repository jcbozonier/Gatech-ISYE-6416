\begin{abstract}
For this analysis, the aim of linear regression is to model the relationship between three auto manufacturers: Toyata Motor Corp., Ford Motor Corp., and GM. Treat the log returns of GM as response and log returns of Toyota and Ford as predictors. We fit a linear regression model in R and perform necessary model diagnostics. By analyzing the given dataset, we draw the conclusion on whether linear regression is a useful tool for this dataset and find out which predicotrs are playing important roles in this relationship.
